      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To inform curious people about the US official state bird and flower from each state in the Northwest. I will include one, two or three facts about each bird and flower. I will present it in an easy to read and follow card format without ads in the way.</p>

      <p>Notice: I downsized my site content to feature only the five states in the Northwest region (Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming) so I don't have to collect information and images for 100 items total since that's probably too ambitious and time-consuming for this project.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Anyone curious about these state birds or flowers. Most viewers will be US citizens, especially people who live in one of the states featured. A wide range of ages, ages 8 to 75, can visit my site. Because of my color choices, my site may appeal more to feminine people.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello, curious reader, and welcome to Northwest State Birds and Flowers. Here you will find information and facts about the official state bird and flower for each US State that make up the Northwest region. I've lived in this area for the last ten or eleven years and I wanted to show some appreciation for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my site I will be covering the official flowers and birds of the five states in the Northwest region of the United States. These include Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming.

      <h3>Official State Birds and Flowers</h3>
      <p>
        Idaho <br>
        Mountain Bluejay<br>
        Scientific Name: Sialia currucoides<br>
        This bird likes to hang out in semi-open areas with a few trees, making nests in tree hollows, dirt banks, or cliffs. It can be found mostly in Western Canada, Western United States, and sometimes in Alaska, Texas, and Mexico. It stands about seven inches tall. Even though the mountain bluebird is obviously blue, it doesn’t have any blue pigment in its feathers! They look blue because their feather barbs have cells that absorb every color but blue, which is reflected.<br>
        Mock Orange<br>
        Scientific Name: Philadelphus coronarius<br>
        The mock orange flower is between ten to fifteen feet tall and blooms in springtime. The flowers themselves grow on a shrub. It gets its common name from seemingly imitating real orange blossoms. The first part of the scientific name, Philadelphus, is supposedly referencing the Egyptian King Ptolemy Philadelphus.<br>
        Notice: three of the states listed have the same state bird (Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming). I will list each bird in the state section, but there are different facts for each entry.
        <br>
        Montana<br>
        Western Meadowlark<br>
        Scientific Name: Sturnella neglecta<br>
        The western meadowlark is recognized by its distinct birdsong. It can easily be confused with the eastern meadowlark because both of these species are almost identical. In 1930, the state of Montana asked its school children what bird represented the state best. They and the state legislators agreed on the western meadowlark and made it official the next year in 1931.<br>
        Bitterroot<br>
        Scientific Name: Lewisia rediviva<br>
        The roots of bitterroot, as conveyed by the name, are bitter to the taste. People don’t usually eat it raw because of this, and because it causes swelling. Bitterroot can live without water for over a year, which is probably why the second part of its scientific name is rediviva, meaning “reviving.” Bitterroot also has some medicinal properties when prepared correctly.
        <br>
        Oregon<br>
        Western Meadowlark<br>
        Scientific Name: Sturnella neglecta<br>
        This bird is found in a broad range across North America in South-Central Canada, Western America, and Mexico. They are between eight and eleven inches tall. Oregon chose the western meadowlark to represent the state in 1927 by children’s vote. In 2017, the Oregon legislature tried to change the state bird to the osprey, but they failed, considering it remains the same seven years later.<br>
        Oregon Grape<br>
        Scientific Name: Berberis Aquifolium<br>
        Despite the flower’s common name, they’re not literally grapes. This flower blooms in the spring and does turn into berries by fall, but it only looks similar to wild grapes. Many fruit-eating birds and mammals eat the berries. Oregon grapes can grow between three to six feet tall.
        <br>
        Washington<br>
        Goldfinch<br>
        Scientific Name: Spinus Tristis<br>
        The goldfinch is found everywhere in America, Southern Canada, and some parts of Mexico. The females are pale gold compared to the males (depicted in the photo). Many sources report that one type of goldfinch call sounds like the phrase “po-ta-to-chip.” They can be found year-round throughout most of Washington. Goldfinches eat seeds almost exclusively, unlike many other birds that eat a mix of seeds, berries, and/or insects.<br>
        Coast Rhododendron<br>
        Scientific Name: Rhododendron macrophyllum<br>
        The scientific name of this flower means “rose tree with big leaves.” In America, it’s largely found on the Pacific Northwest coast, in Washington, Oregon, and California. Most of them are found across the ocean in China, Japan, and surrounding areas. While the flower is very pretty, it doesn’t have much usefulness besides providing cover for animals to hide under.
        <br>
        Wyoming<br>
        Western Meadlowark<br>
        Scientific Name: Sturnella neglecta<br>
        The call of the western meadowlark is complex and flute-like. Star Wars fans (like me) may notice it sounds very similar to R2D2’s squeaks and beeps! They make their nests on the ground in hollows of grass, so oftentimes there’s a grass roof covering part of the nest. The state of Wyoming chose the western meadowlark as their state bird in 1927.<br>
        Indian Paintbrush<br>
        Scientific Name: Castilleja coccinea<br>
        This flower got its common name from the legend about a Native American who wanted to paint the sunset. In real life, Native Americans used it in food, but also as a poison for their enemies because it has toxic properties. This flower isn’t very common in Wyoming, despite being the state flower. It’s found mostly in Eastern America and Canada. This plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it gets nutrients from photosynthesis, they also steal nutrients from other plants surrounding them.
