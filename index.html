                    <p>Hello! I'm from Idaho Falls, ID, and this is my first semester at BYU-I! I'm majoring in Web Design and Development. I hope to pursue web design as a career after I graduate.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy reading fantasy books. It's hard to choose favorites, but some series I've enjoyed are Ranger's Apprentice, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Wingfeather Saga, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.</p>
                    <p>I also love to knit. I've made a blanket, a cardigan, hats, and stuffed animals. I'm currently working on a super long hat that doubles as a scarf.</p>
